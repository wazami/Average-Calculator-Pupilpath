# Average-Calculator-Pupilpath
Old project that I worked on that I decided to upload to github to learn the mechanics of github some more. Any advice on how to make it more efficient would be greatly appreciated. I will be updating this file, hopefully by incorporating a login system based off of mongoDB.  

---OBJECTIVE---
Give students the ability to calculate both their individual class averages and their overall class averages in the event that they are ambiguous to the student or just because the student wants to know where they stand. The addition of the login system would allow the students data to remain and hopefully allow the possiblity of statistical analysis being incorporated in to the program.


Really simple python script. I'll add comments later.
